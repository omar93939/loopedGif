# loopedGif
Checks if gif is looped using homebrew gif preprocessing and feeding it into homebrew TensorFlowjs (layers) Neural Network. Made for Nodejs (penultimately Nestjs)
Some of the parameters may seem odd to require in some cases, but that is simply because this repo was made with a specific use case in mind. It should be rather simple for anyone to port this mechanism if desired
